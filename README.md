Another VR Dungeon Game
Creator: Harrison Johns (responsible for code)

This is a VR game made with C# and Unity I worked on for a few weeks in August 2023 before I stopped working on it. It was meant to be simply an exploration of programming with VR/XRl. It ended in a pre-alpha, unfinished state, so there are many bugs, it is heavily unbalanced, and there is no SFX. The game can be played and downloaded at the link below, however remember that I just wanted to explore coding with VR/XR.

You may notice that the player's body is missing in the build provided, but the scripts for a full inverse kinematics body are available in this repository. The IK body works decently, but I decided to not include it in the build for immersion and to reduce the amount of bugs. I did not create the visual assets used in the build.

Feel free to use any of the code in this project.
